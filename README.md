# CancerCellPrediction
A simple machine learning Python project to predict whether or not cancer cells are benign or malign.

According to the CDC, breast cancer is the second most common cancer behind skin cancer and also the second leading cause of death among women  in the United States. Recently, Research on breast cancer have focused on improving diagnosis methods as it is often revealed that early detection of cancer have real impacts on treatment and recovery. Several clinical and computational  tools have been used to improve the effectiveness of existing diagnosis methods;  Machine learning methods such as: Decision trees, Support Vector machines, and Random Forests have also been used  to help classify cancer cells into cancerous and non-cancerous types. This approach was used by Dr Wolberg from the university of Wisconsin who collected fluid samples from patient breasts and  used  the graphical software  Xcyt  to  generate a publicly available dataset  which can be found at : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29.

The code in this repository  evaluates the effectiveness of Machine Learning models such as DT, SVM and RF  at accurately  detecting malign cancerous cells.
